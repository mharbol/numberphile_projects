[Matt Parker](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths) did not add his code to this great little bit of recreational number theory to this video. Did my best to faithfully reproduce both his method and code for personal usage.
Please see [The Reciprocals of Primes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmfxIhmGPP4&t=620s) on Numberphile for more information.
